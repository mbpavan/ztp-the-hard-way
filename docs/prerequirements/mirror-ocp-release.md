# Mirror the OCP Release

I think you already did this for the Hub cluster deployment but let's review it.

**Remember** This is a supported step and it's officially documented here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.html#installing-mirroring-installation-images

Said that let's go through the process.

First thing we need it's the `oc` client, to best way to do it's downloading from [here](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/oc/), but if you have already one even if it's outdated, you can use this script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

## Variables
export PULL_SECRET_JSON=$(pwd)/pull_secret.json
export LOCAL_REGISTRY=$(hostname):443
export LOCAL_REPOSITORY=ocp4
export OCP_RELEASE=4.9.0-x86_64
export OCP_REGISTRY=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release

## Functional
function ocp_mirror_release() {
  oc adm -a ${PULL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
         --from=${OCP_REGISTRY}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
         --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
         --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}
         --max-per-registry=1
}

function download_oc_client() {
  oc adm --registry-config ${PULL_SECRET_JSON} release extract \
	--command=oc \
	--from=${OCP_REGISTRY}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
	--to .

  if [[ ! -f oc ]];then
    echo "OC Client wasn't extracted, exiting..."
    exit 1
  fi

  mv oc /home/kni/bin/oc
}

download_oc_client
ocp_mirror_release
```

Executing this script should be ok to download and update the `oc` client and also mirror the OpenShift Release, so ensure you add the relevant `ImageContentSourcePolicies` to your `InstallConfig` for the Hub deployment and also for the Spoke deployments that we will explain in a later section.
